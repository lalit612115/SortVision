# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based application to visualize how different sorting algorithms work in real-time. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the core concepts of sorting algorithms, their comparisons, and swaps.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

[https://sortingrepresent.netlify.app/]

## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with a dynamic graphical representation of the array.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a list of classic sorting algorithms to visualize:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Shell Sort
- **Customizable Array**: Adjust the size of the array to observe performance differences.
- **Speed Control**: Change the animation speed to slow down or speed up the visualization.
- **Step-by-Step Control**: Manually pause and advance the sorting process one step at a time to examine each comparison and swap in detail.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

This project is built using a simple and classic web stack:

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and a modern user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core logic for all sorting algorithms, canvas drawing, and user interactions.
